# The data Injection PoC
This project was part of learning the spring framwork and integrating a personal project

The Goal:
1: Use a Mongo datastore to pull data from a REST interface exposed by a VPLEX array.
2: Motify the code to use the spring framwork to use IoC 

Preconditions:
1: You will need a VPLEX Rest interface :( sorry no emulators here.
2: Mongo needs to be running on the default port with no username and password.
